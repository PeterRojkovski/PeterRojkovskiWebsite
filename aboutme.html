   <h3>Who Is Peter Rojkovski?</h3>
    <p class="description">Hello there!<br>My name is Peter Rojkovski and I am a student at Robert Thirsk High School in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. I was born in Calgary, however my family is completely Russian. I am passionate about STEM classes in school, and my favourite subjects are math and computer science. <br>Outside of school I have been competing in biathlon for about 7 years now, and it is a passion of mine. I have also been coaching of late, and I enjoy playing the piano and reading in the little spare time that I have left. I aspire to work with computers when I am older, because I believe that computers are the future. I thoroughly enjoy coding and learning about the internet, and computers get you quite a bit of money. I hope that I can work and utilize my skils in a way that intrigues me and benifits others. Who knows, I might just be the next Bill Gates. :)</p>
